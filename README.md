# Greetings

I'm Kyla (she/her), a self-proclaimed ***datalark***! My journey as a data analyst has taken me on numerous adventures across various disciplines. My background is in sociology, and for the past 2+ years I have worked at **PBCAR**, working on projects related to mental health and substance use research.

An avid R user, I find it rewarding to implement new statistical methods and data visualization techniques. I enjoy documenting both data processing and visualization techniques to help others gain new skills. I also use my R skills as a volunteer with **CCODWG**, starting first with building a dashboard to disseminate data to the public and now helping to automate the data collection process.
