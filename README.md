# Greetings

I'm Kyla (she/her), a self-proclaimed ***datalark***! My journey as a data analyst has taken me on numerous adventures across various disciplines. My background is in sociology, and for the past 2+ years I have worked at **PBCAR**, working on projects related to mental health and substance use research.

I am passionate about all aspects of data analysis: from cleaning and processing 10+ waves of data for a longitudinal cohort and documenting the processing in a comprehensive guide book; to building complex structural equation models using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) or Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Modelling (RI-CLPMs) techniques. 

An avid R user, I find it rewarding to implement new statistical methods and data visualization techniques. I enjoy documenting both data processing and visualization techniques to help others gain new skills. I also use my R skills as a volunteer with **CCODWG**, starting first with building a dashboard to disseminate data to the public and now helping to automate the data collection process.
