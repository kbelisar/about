# About Me

Fully aboard the R train! Passionate about learning new skills and techniques, I am always seeking new ways to use R in my work at PBCAR. I am also a volunteer with CCODWG on their Dashboard project, allowing me to learn new data visualization techniques to disseminate data to the public.
