## Greetings

I'm Kyla (she/her), a self-proclaimed ***datalark***! My background is in sociology, although I have worked across numerous disciplines. For the past 5+ years I have worked at [PBCAR](https://github.com/PBCAR) as a biostatistician and researcher on projects related to mental health and substance use research.

An avid R user, I find it rewarding to implement new statistical methods and data visualization techniques. I have used my R skills as a volunteer with [CCODWG](https://github.com/ccodwg), to both build a dashboard to disseminate data for the public and to automate the data collection process. I enjoy documenting the steps of data processing, analytical methods, and visualization techniques to help others gain new skills. I also enjoy the challenge of building R packages, carefully documenting functions and different use cases.
